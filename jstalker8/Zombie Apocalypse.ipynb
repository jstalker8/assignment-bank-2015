For my final project I have choosen a topic that while interesting to model, is hopefully (atleast for our sake) never going to be encountered.  This model will require some assumptions be made so it is not intended to be perfect mathmatical representation of this dooms day scenario.

    "The first step in modeling for this dooms day scenario would be to define what a zombie is for anyone who doesn't already know.  Per wikipedia, zombies are fictional undead creatures created through the reanimation of human corpses.  Usually in these doomsday senerious some virus is inadventurently introduced into the general population with an initial patient, commonly refered to as \"patient zero\" being the first zombie.  Zombies don't require anything like food or water to live however they do have a insasibable appiteite for human flesh.  The zombie virus is then spread through the population by bites from infected indiviuals.  My project will work under the assumption that this outbreak has already occured however there is a \"safe\" community inside of a walled city that is keeping all the infected at bay."

    "So what's there to model right?  All the undead are outside of the city with only the living inside, what could go wrong?  As fans of the AMC television show \"The Walking Dead\" know, these \"safe\" communities never stay safe for long. Usually there is some kind of a breech in the wall that lets the flood of the undead in but one way or another the infected always find there way inside.  For this model lets take a page out of that tv show and assume a mysterious zombie virus has apparently infected everyone in the population. The living keep the virus in check by some unknown means but when someone dies—whether quickly after being bitten by a zombie or by natural causes the result is the same: After death, everyone is reanimated as a bloodthirsty zombie.  In this scenario it doesn't matter how you die, if the brain is still intact that person will become a zombie. "
