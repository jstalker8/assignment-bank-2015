    "The first step in modeling for this dooms day scenario would be to basically define what a zombie is.  Per wikipedia, zombies are fictional undead creatures created through the reanimation of human corpses.  Usually in these doomsday senerious some virus is inadventurently introduced into the general population with an initial patient, commonly refered to as \"patient zero\" being the first zombie.  Zombies don't require anything like food or water to live however they do have a insasibable appiteite for human flesh.  The zombie virus is then spread through the population by bites from infected indiviuals.  My project will work under the assumption that this outbreak has already occured however there is a \"safe\" community inside of a walled city that is keeping all the infected at bay."

Well lets take a page out of the AMC tv show The Walking Dead and assume that everyone in the world is already infected with this zombie virus and it doesn't matter if you die from a zombie bite or natural causes, you still have the potential to come back as a zombie as long as the cause of death didn't come from a serve brain injury (which is of course the only way to kill a zombie).  For this model we will assume that someone, somewhere inside our city died from natural causes and came back as our patient zero."
